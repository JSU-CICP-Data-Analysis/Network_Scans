# Network_Scans
Functions to check for changes to network data in features that normaly exhibit only a limited number of values

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook created to identify changes to categorical network data features. It contains two functions, one for identifying categorical features within the normal operating data for a network, and a second for identifying when values outside of those previously seen categories appear. These anomalous changes could indicate an intrusion attempt, such as a port or network scan.
An additional function is included for generating example datasets, both a benign dataset, and one containing attacks.
